<p class="text">We'll pay you $5 for activating your account.&nbsp; To do this, after&nbsp;signing up&nbsp;you'll need to look for your first&nbsp;PaidEmail&nbsp;in your email inbox and confirm receiving it.&nbsp; Tip: it may take a couple minutes or more for it to show up. And if you don't see it in your primary inbox, check your promo, social, spam, or other filtered folders.
