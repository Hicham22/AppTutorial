<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"the more, the merrier"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Having many devices is the key to maximize your earnings, since you have a limit on the number of honeygain instances running on the same network, you have to find ways to have either more wifi connections (maybe one at home, one at work, etc...) and use mobile data when you can.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you dont have much mobile data you can use the function limiting its usage, in this way you dont risk losing your internet.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The referral codes are another way to gain more, invite and many friends as you can!</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Content delivery is my last suggestion, if you're located in a country that supports it, be sure to have it on.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Raspberry Pi machines are extremely cheap to run, so if left powered on 24/7, every day of the year, with content delivery enabled, you're extremely likely to make a profit off of an investment into one if your connection is above 10mb/s (recommended for content delivery).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I picked up a secondhand RasPi 3 or 4 months ago and I've made 8000Cr from it, as well as running other services/apps and running a small Minecraft server. I'd guess my RasPi has probably made me about &pound;30 so far across crypto and bandwidth services which isn't bad considering I paid &pound;14 for it and it costs around &pound;5 a year to keep fully powered on.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you don't have many devices, the best way to earn credits is through your phone. I've been using Honeygain for more than a year and most of the credits I have earned are from my phone. The app is very simple to use, doesn't drain your battery like crazy. Just run it and leave it in the background. Doesn't slow your phone, it just earns you money. Having the app installed, you'll be eligible to get the Lucky Jar every day, so if the luck is on your side, you'll earn even more credits. If you have more devices and you go to school/work and if you have access to WiFi there, just run it on the other device to maximize your Honeygain earnings, it's that simple :) Also, don't forget to refer the app to friends/family using your referral link, which will additionally bring you some more credits, passive income. And, of course, if Content Delivery is available in your country, don't forget to enable it.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Hello so here is my tips to make good earning with honeygain :</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Referrals make a good additional earning but its not stable if people you refer doesnt get good earning with their honeygain , so its additional earning but not the stable one</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- 10 devices : is it important to maximize your devices to 10 or atleast near 10 because devices will make you much demand i have 6 devices and i earn 100-200 credits or maybe 300 cr everyday , more devices more earnings</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- the content delivery : if you are in a country that has content delivery always actif like in Europe you may use lot of computer devices for example if u have 3 devices pc you can earn 600 cr only from pc and add 3 more phones so you can make 800 cr everyday which is good earning from honeygain</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Another tip is to use phone devices if you dont have content delivery in your country bcs honeygain use data more than pc also the energy cost advantage with mobile.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">just to know sometimes with phone you can earn 1 GB or maybe 10 GB /day so you dont know what will happen but the main idea is to try to max earning your only effort that you can do is to add devices as much as you can , the demand depends on honeygain clients and area too , top tier countries has the best demand and best income from so you can advertise them honeygain to gain from referrals</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- dont forget to open honeyjar everyday its a gift from honeygain that you can earn 2-5 dollars everymonth so thnx honeygain for this gift too</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Remember your only effort is to add the maximum of devices you can and sharing your referral links with people , use facebook , twitter and also tiktok if you have tiktok account make honeygain video , if you have youtube too make a video about honeygain and show em your payouts so people can trust you and join with your referral</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Update your apps and software I find when I update an app or software on my pc and phone it give a lot of data.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A quick tip for both beginners and powerusers, make maximum use of your devices: don't just run Honeygain on it, make use of other platforms as well, be them competitors or other passive money-making apps and sites. Doesn't exactly increase your Honeygain earnings but definitely brings a smile on your face if Honeygain's not doing that great yet you're still making money :)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Earning with:</p>
<ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Normal bandwidth selling and content delivery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you have some spare computers, phones and internet connections at your disposal, make full use of them: Honeygain uses 10% of your bandwidth&nbsp;<span class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">per device</span>&nbsp;(from my understanding) so having 2 devices on 1 IP lets Honeygain utilize 20% and also provides stability.<br />If you haven't maxed out your device limit and after 1-2 months of use the earnings are still high, then consider expanding your operations. Expand only after that amount of time as the first 1-2 weeks are when Honeygain tests your network with "dummy" data and thus could result in higher earnings. I've seen people go all in too early and then be mad that their earnings dropped drastically. Get some Android 6 and above phones and additional connections. If your country has unlimited data plans available for phones at a reasonable cost then you consider using those but of course a cable connection would be better as it tends to be more stable and faster.<br />In case of computers, if you want to run them 24/7 then make sure that the power cost is reasonable and can be offset with your earnings. Hook them up to your fastest connection(s) and if possible, turn on content delivery. It uses more bandwidth and pays you by the hour but in most cases it can earn you far more than the normal bandwidth service.<br />Installing the app on your close ones' devices is also an option (do that only with full consent and make sure they understand why!) but that can be unreliable earnings wise as the app could go down and you couldn't fix it right away.</p>
<ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Referrals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Referring can be a gold mine if you're good at marketing or have a lot influencer power over people. Just by checking HG's Discord you can see people who earn ~$0.20 per day from sharing bandwidth but $2-5 per day from referrals but these numbers require quite a bit of work. It isn't 2019 anymore (when HG launched) and simply dropping your referral link on money-making forums and subreddits won't get you tons of referrals but probably backlash instead because everyone knows about HG at this point.<br />This means that the two obvious routes to go are marketing and influencing. In both cases you'd need a niche where people would like to earn extra money but probably aren't familiar enough with beermoney community to know about Honeygain, for example, artists.<br />In case of marketing, you could try setting up ad campaigns on various platforms that catch artists' attention to, for example, recoup their supply costs. This requires quite a bit of knowledge of ad platforms and making ads that actually work + some money for advertising which can get costly at times.<br />- Becoming an online influencer isn't exactly a quick method either as you'd have to pick a platform, start making content that hooks people and then subtly plug Honeygain. If you have some influence in a group of people IRL (for example an art class) then you could do some mouth-to-mouth promotion there.<br />Again, there's the option of utilizing FFF (friends, family, fools) but I doubt there are a lot of you out there who have friends and family that are eagerly interested in making money online in ways they probably don't understand.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Not much to say here, it's basically a daily bonus that has to be claimed manually. Do your best to claim it daily as even if you get only 10-20Cr per day, it can still earn you some extra.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Here are a few tips-</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">1-Use social media to promote your referrals 2-tell your friends about it 3-log in everyday for that sweet honey jar where you have a chance to earn anywhere from 10 credits all the way upto 10000(10$) 4-use content delivery on desktop if possible 5-when you navigate through the application a little slower, you have higher chances of getting more credits from the jar 6-make sure to have a high speed and stable connection 7-run background applications such as Spotify so that even though you aren't going to use your phone, you still earn money 8-the app awards getting internet traffic so downloading heavy games or stuff like that won't get you very far, whereas browsing the internet is key 9-only 3 devices are allowed in one ip address so try to get more if possible 10-since it is passive income, you can download it on your family member's phones</p>
