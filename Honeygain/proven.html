<p>Take a look at this tested result below;</p>

<p>Running HoneyGain on computers earn at the rate of 2x or even 3x faster than mobile devices.&nbsp;The processing speed of these devices matters too.&nbsp;So go for faster devices if possible.</p>
<h3 id="2-add-3-devices-per-residential-ip"><span id="2-add-3-devices-per-residential-ip" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>2. Add 3 devices per residential IP</h3>
<p>For most of us using residential IP addresses, up to 3 devices are allowed.</p>
<p>Increase your earning chances by installing it on all three (3) different devices.&nbsp;However, for business IP addresses, one computing device is only allowed.</p>
<h3 id="3-turn-off-mobile-batttery-optimization-on-mobile-devices"><span id="3-turn-off-mobile-battery-optimization-on-mobile-devices" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>3. Turn off Mobile Battery Optimization on Mobile devices</h3>
<p>Android has a Battery Optimization function in its operating system that helps save the battery’s life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this function appeals to many of us, it is actually a hindrance to the HoneyGain app.&nbsp;After a certain amount of time, Android will auto-shutoff the background processing of HoneyGain if the app has not been opened for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure HoneyGain constantly runs in the background,&nbsp;<span>turn off</span>&nbsp;Battery Optimization in your Settings.</p>

<h3 id="4-running-honeygain-24-7-in-the-background"><span id="4-running-honeygain-247-in-the-background" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>4. Running Honeygain 24/7 in the Background</h3>
<p>The longer we allow&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;to run on our devices, the higher the chances of more profits we may earn.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are typically operating 24/7 and should not be an issue here.&nbsp;However, consider letting your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux) run for as long as possible to maximise earning potential.</p>
<h3 id="5-connectivity-type-wifi-vs-wired"><span id="5-connectivity-type-wifi-vs-wired" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>5. Connectivity Type (Wifi vs Wired)</h3>
<p>If you have a wired direct (Ethernet) connection to your computer, that is considered having a stable and faster internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wired connection has a faster internet connection speed than a wireless connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VPN services are used by many and are great for various activities such as staying anonymous while browsing the web, downloading from bit torrents, overcoming geo-restrictions contents, etc.,</p>
<p>HoneyGain, however, does not support the use of VPN internet connections. So remember to turn off VPN services when you are using them.</p>
<h3 id="6-connection-usage-use-wifi-or-mobile-data"><span id="6-connection-usage-use-wifi-or-mobile-data" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>6. Connection Usage (Use Wifi or Mobile Data)</h3>
<p>You can choose to either share your internet connection using Wifi-only, using Mobile Data or both.</p>
<p>If your mobile subscription plan allows, you can consider allocating a portion of your monthly unused quota to HoneyGain.</p>
<p>During our&nbsp;HoneyGain experiment, we used a mobile device with a monthly mobile subscription plan of 30GB of data that we often utilise only 5-10GB every month. Therefore we can safely test and allocate the remaining for HoneyGain to use.</p>
<p>During the first time installing HoneyGain on a mobile device, you will be asked if you want to allocate mobile data. You have the option to enter the amount in GB.</p>

<p>You can toggle mobile data usage on and off under the app’s Settings.</p>
<h3 id="7-depends-on-your-country-and-usage-demand"><span id="7-depends-on-your-country-and-usage-demand" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>7. Depends on your Country and Usage Demand</h3>
<p>Certain countries and specific timing can be lucrative when it comes to earnings.</p>
<p>You can study the last 30 days graph in your Dashboard to determine which days are lucrative if you don’t intend to run your devices 24/7.</p>
<h3 id="8-enable-content-delivery"><span id="8-enable-content-delivery" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>8. Enable Content Delivery</h3>
<p>You can opt for Content Delivery (beta), which allows HoneyGain to use your internet connection for bandwidth-intensive content such as video streaming audio and images.&nbsp;In doing so, you can earn more and faster than mobile devices.</p>
<p>Content Delivery only works on computers now, and it supports Windows, macOS and Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you stay in a country where it is currently supported, you can&nbsp;<span>enable it under your Settings menu</span>.</p>
<h3 id="9-claim-daily-bonus"><span id="9-claim-daily-bonus" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>9. Claim Daily Bonus</h3>
