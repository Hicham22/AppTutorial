<p>In a study by Proxyway, this technological segment was coined as&nbsp;proxyware applications&nbsp;that rent out your IP address to companies for collecting publicly available online data and bypassing geographical restrictions to perform business operations like price comparison or ad verification. Honeygain is a free Internet-sharing application that lets its users make money by running the application as a background task on their phone or tablet.</p>
<p>It is an interesting technological development that fascinates many tech enthusiasts. Still, the main upside to downloading apps like Honeygain is the remuneration for the shared Internet connection. Many users view this app as a passive income stream that became a crucial financial part of the recent&nbsp;inflation surge in Europe&nbsp;and the rest of the world. While the payout might be small compared to a full-time job&rsquo;s salary, it is a technological advancement that can influence your viewpoint on money-making opportunities.</p>
