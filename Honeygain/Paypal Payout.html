<p>The company uses their app to utilise your unused internet connection in return for rewarding you in cash.&nbsp;If you are unsure what is HoneyGain, please&nbsp;read this complete guide for beginners here.</p>
<p>We conclude that it is entirely legit and possible to earn money from their&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;app through our experience in cashing out our earnings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-the-honeygain-minimum-payout-threshold-1">How long does it take to reach the Honeygain minimum payout threshold?</h2>
<p>Evidently, it took us a full five (5) months to reach the minimum payout amount of USD 20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like a long time? No fret.</p>
<p>We learnt a great deal in the process and now understand&nbsp;how to increase our earnings&nbsp;the next time.</p>
<p>That is from the time we started using it on 21 Sept 2020 (see below)</p>

<p>And we requested a cash payout on 4 March 2021 (see below)</p>

<p>We installed their app on one (1) single Windows computer that was constantly active 24/7 with a typical home internet broadband using Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>
<p>Also, we installed their app on 2 Android devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, our experiment started with zero balance in our&nbsp;HoneyGain account. This means we intentionally did not obtain any&nbsp;free USD 5 upfront balance&nbsp;during the app&rsquo;s first installation.</p>

<p>The entire withdrawal method is detailed in 8 simple steps with screenshots in this article.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-request-payout" class="has-normal-font-size"><span id="step-1-request-payout" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Step 1: Request Payout</h3>
<p>Log in to your HoneyGain Dashboard and click &ldquo;Request Payout&rdquo;. Ensure that you have reached a minimum payout of USD 20.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-429 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout-1024x584.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x352/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Requesting Payout from the HoneyGain Dashboard" width="768" height="438" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout-1024x584.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout-300x171.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout-768x438.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1516w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-Dashboard-showing-request-payout-1024x584.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x352/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /><em>Click the &ldquo;Request Payout&rdquo; blue button to start the withdrawal process.</em></p>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-payout-option" class="has-normal-font-size"><span id="step-2-choose-payout-option" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Step 2: Choose Payout Option</h3>
<p>Choose PayPal as your withdrawal option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point of the&nbsp;Honeygain&nbsp;payout request, it does not matter if you have an existing Paypal account or not.</p>
<p>You can create a free Paypal account subsequently.</p>
<p>It also does not matter if your HoneyGain account&rsquo;s email address is not the same as your Paypal account.</p>
<p>You will have to wait for an email from HoneyGain to confirm your Paypal email address via their payout provider Tipaltic. This will take about a day.</p>

<p>Using&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;is simply a very passive way of earning an extra income.</p>
<p>No effort or time is needed to maintain or work on it. From our tested review, we simply installed it and forgot it.</p>
<p>Read more about the&nbsp;11 proven ways to increase your HoneyGain earnings&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>There are several tactics to earn more using HoneyGain, and we have tested it to be safe and non-battery intrusive.</p>
<p><span>Start using the&nbsp;</span>HoneyGain app now with a&nbsp;FREE USD 5 balance upon installation. Install it on some of your devices, leave it overnight running in the background and withdraw some money a few months later.</p>
<p>If you want to&nbsp;withdraw your payout in Bitcoin (BTC), you can get your own deposit wallet address from&nbsp;Binance&nbsp;or&nbsp;Coinbase.</p>
