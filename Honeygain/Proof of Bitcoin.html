<h2 id="faq"><span id="faq" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-withdraw-btc-from-honeygain-to-the-wallet-address"><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-withdraw-btc-from-honeygain-to-the-wallet-address" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>How long does it take to withdraw BTC from Honeygain to the wallet address?</h3>
<p>It will take exactly two (2) business days to see the BTC in your wallet address.<br />If the day of your BTC withdrawal request falls on a business day, it is counted as Day 1.<br /><br />Business Day is defined as Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.</p>
<p>You can use any BTC wallet of your choice, such as an&nbsp;exchange wallet address&nbsp;a software or hardware wallet address.</p>
<p>In this article, the request for BTC payout was made on&nbsp;<span>Friday, 14 May 2021, at 7 am</span>&nbsp;(UTC Time), and HoneyGain was deposited into the BTC wallet on&nbsp;<span>Monday, 17 May 2021,</span>&nbsp;11:30 am (UTC Time). This is precisely 2 business days of processing.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-the-btc-amount-has-been-deposited-into-my-wallet-address"><span id="how-do-i-know-if-the-btc-amount-has-been-deposited-into-my-wallet-address" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>How do I know if the BTC amount has been deposited into my wallet address?</h3>
<p>If you are using a cryptocurrency exchange like&nbsp;Binance, it will inform you via email of every deposit that enters your account. Login to your exchange and confirm the amount.</p>
<p>If you use other software or hardware wallets, you will likely have to check once two (2) business days are up manually as there will be no notifications to you.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-honeygain-s-transaction-fee-or-processing-fee-when-converting-usd-to-bitcoin-btc"><span id="how-much-is-honeygains-transaction-fee-or-processing-fee-when-converting-usd-to-bitcoin-btc" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>How much is Honeygain&rsquo;s transaction fee or processing fee when converting USD to Bitcoin (BTC)?</h3>
<p>On the surface level, you do not get to see the deducted transaction or processing fee that&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;imposes.</p>
<p>Because the conversion rate from USD dollars into Bitcoin (BTC) is done through their appointed conversion agent, BitcoinAverage.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><span>However, we could check if the conversion amount is acceptable</span>.</p>
<p>For my payout of USD 21.03, it was converted into&nbsp;<span><span>0.00046565 BTC</span></span>&nbsp;(figure below)</p>
<p><span><img class="wp-image-617 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-1024x136.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x82/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Binance showing HoneyGain Bitcoin deposit successful" width="1024" height="136" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-1024x136.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-300x40.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-768x102.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-1536x203.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1536w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-2048x271.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 2048w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-deposit-confirm-1-1024x136.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x82/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /></span></p>
<p>A quick check on the average price of BTC at that time, 14 May 2021 at 7 am UTC, and it was USD 49,855.23, which converts to&nbsp;<span>0.00042182 BTC</span>&nbsp;(figure below)</p>
<p><span><img class="wp-image-614 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-1024x229.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x138/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Average price of bitcoin graph" width="1024" height="229" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-1024x229.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-300x67.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-768x171.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-1536x343.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1536w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-2048x457.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 2048w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/honeygain-btc-average-price-upon-request-payout-1024x229.png?ezimgfmt=rs:618x138/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /></span></p>
<p><br />In conclusion, the&nbsp;<span>conversion rate has to be done upon our request date</span>&nbsp;(14 May in this example) because the price of BTC dropped several thousand dollars on the 17th May, the day I deposited to my wallet address.</p>
<p>And the conversion rate was higher than the average price of Bitcoin across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore the conversion rate is acceptable.</p>
<p>Through my personal tried and tested ways for over a year of using HoneyGain, there are a total of&nbsp;11 different ways to increase and speed up our earnings.</p>
