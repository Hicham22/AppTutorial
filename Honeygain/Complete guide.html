<p>Truly automated, effortless way of earning a source of passive income.</p>
<p>Not many apps or services can proclaim themselves as an &ldquo;effortless&rdquo; way of earning passive income.</p>
<p>Honeygain&nbsp;is definitely one of those who could say that.</p>
<p>I have personally used the app for two (2) years now while enjoying consistent small payouts without any effort in using it.</p>
<p>This article will explain everything you need to know in detail as a HoneyGain beginner.</p>
<p>I also included my personal experiences of using the app, explaining its functions and, most importantly, the various tips and tricks that can make you earn more.</p>
<p>This article is also geared towards the experienced seeking new ways and ideas to earn more using the app.</p>
<p>The topics (shown below) are arranged intentionally in this chronological order of learning. They are written specifically for you to understand and use the app effectively as an automated passive source of income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-honeygain-and-how-does-it-work">What is Honeygain, And How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>It is an app that allows users to earn money by sharing their unused internet connection.</p>
<p>Internet sharing can be either through Wi-Fi, mobile data, or both, and users can control the limit of sharing when it comes to mobile data.</p>
<p>Honeygain&nbsp;is basically a form of &ldquo;<span>automated passive income stream</span>&rdquo; as it generally involves no efforts on the users&rsquo; part.</p>
<p>We install it on our phones and computers devices and leave it running in the background. In short, we do not have to put in any effort at all. The amount of internet network we share gets converted into dollars and cents.</p>
<p>The unused internet connection we shared is gathered by the Honeygain network and used by researchers from e-commerce, advertising, and web intelligence companies. These companies extract insights from the web to enable topics of interest such as market research, brand protection and many others.</p>
<p>The company is a 100% remote company with a staff strength of over 20+ across different countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking,&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;is simply an &ldquo;install and earn&rdquo; mobile &amp; computer app which is easy to use. All users need to do is allow the app to run in the background, to make some earnings.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-considered-legit-safe-to-use"><span id="is-it-considered-legit-safe-to-use" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Is it Considered Legit &amp; Safe To Use?</h2>
<p>The app really pays out to its users, and I have had&nbsp;several withdrawal payouts so far, with no issues or delays.</p>
<p>So far, there has not been any negative news on the company or the app either.</p>
<p>There was no issue running the app on both the mobile devices and computers I had installed.</p>
<p>As for the connection between our devices and HoneyGain, the company stated that it is always fully encrypted and inaccessible by outsiders, assuring that any potential form of personal information leakage risk is well taken care of.</p>
<p>You should be of legal age of maturity, which is dependable on which country you live in. If you happen to be underage, you might need your parent&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s permission to use Honeygain.</p>
<p>However, the company does not strictly enforce this, and there is no need to inform them about the permission.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-data-does-it-collect"><span id="what-type-of-data-does-it-collect" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What Type of Data Does It Collect?</h2>
<p>According to their website&rsquo;s&nbsp;helpdesk page, the company stated that the only data they collect from their users are those deemed necessary for the services, including users&rsquo; email addresses, I.P. addresses, and payout methods.</p>
<h2 id="will-it-drain-my-battery"><span id="will-it-drain-my-battery" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Will It Drain My Battery?</h2>
<p>Based on my personal experience using HoneyGain for more than a year on multiple devices, I did not encounter any battery issues while keeping the app running in the background at all times.</p>
<p>In short, the battery life of my devices usually behaves, and I do not associate any battery drainage with the app itself.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-can-i-expect-to-be-earning"><span id="how-much-can-i-expect-to-be-earning" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>How Much Can I Expect To Be Earning?</h2>
<p>Earnings are based on many external factors such as your physical location, the demand for the network in that particular country, network speed, varieties of operating systems used, number of devices connected, number of different I.P. addresses, etc.</p>
<p>The app uses credits to reflect USD currency. For example, 100 Credits equals USD 0.10.</p>
<p>Realistically, a new user can expect to earn between $0.05 to $0.50 daily and can look forward to between $1 to $12 per month.</p>
<p>Yes, it is not a lot, but fret not; there are&nbsp;many proven ways to increase your HoneyGain earnings through various methods.</p>
<p>For a fully automated passive income app like&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;that only runs in the background and requires no effort on the user&rsquo;s part, I do not have any complaints about the amount of money earned here.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-really-pay"><span id="does-it-really-pay" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Does It Really Pay?</h2>
<p>Yes, the company can start paying its users once they reach the minimum payout threshold of USD 20.</p>
<p>Once the users initiate the payout request, the entire process is fast and smooth.</p>
<p>I had written two different articles documenting my HoneyGain payouts, one for transferring to my Paypal account and the other to my Bitcoin wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>HoneyGain to Paypal &ndash; Proof of Payout Payment &amp; Processing Time Taken</li>
<li>HoneyGain to Bitcoin &ndash; Proof of Payout Payment &amp; Payment Time Taken</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-supported-platforms"><span id="what-are-the-supported-platforms" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What are the supported platforms?</h2>
<p>For computer devices, it supports Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>For mobile devices, it currently only supports the Android operating system.</p>
<p>The reason why there is no iOS support is due to the operating system&rsquo;s technical limitations.</p>
<p>Unlike Android, iOS does not allow apps to have &ldquo;background service functionality&rdquo;, which is essential for HoneyGain to operate in the background without having the user constantly open the app and interact with it to keep it active.</p>
<p>IOS users currently won&rsquo;t use the HoneyGain app on their devices.</p>
<p>Note: You should install&nbsp;HoneyGain&nbsp;on both mobile and computer devices to achieve the best results in terms of earnings.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-supported-countries"><span id="what-are-the-supported-countries" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What are the supported countries?</h2>
<p>So far, the good news is the app works in every country in the world.</p>
<p>You should&nbsp;start HoneyGain with a FREE upfront USD 5 balance&nbsp;in your dashboard account.</p>
<p>This way, you will reach your minimum payout threshold of USD 20 in a faster time.</p>
<p>All you need to do now is to&nbsp;click here&nbsp;so that you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own HoneyGain account</li>
<li>Install the app on your selected device platform</li>
<li>Receive the upfront USD $5 as it is automatically applied and shown on your HoneyGain Dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-devices-can-it-support"><span id="how-many-devices-can-it-support" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>How Many Devices Can It Support?</h2>
<p>As of 1st March 2021, the company made the following changes to HoneyGain users.</p>
<p>With the app running actively in the background, you can only connect up to 2 devices sharing the same network. This is the maximum it allows&nbsp;<span><span>per network / I.P</span></span>.</p>
<p>So try to use a variety of connected devices that use either Wi-Fi or mobile data to increase to more than two devices on your account when they don&rsquo;t share the same network.</p>
<p>You can have up to a maximum number of 10 devices that are connected to different networks / I.P.s on your single account dashboard.</p>
<p>Users with more than 10+ different I.P. addresses can join the&nbsp;Swarmbytes platform&nbsp;to enjoy the support of a personal Account Manager and a software suite that manages their infrastructure efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="will-honeygain-used-up-all-my-mobile-data"><span id="will-honeygain-used-up-all-my-mobile-data" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Will Honeygain Used Up All My Mobile Data?</h2>
<p>By default, the app will only use a Wi-Fi connection upon HoneyGain installation (without any settings configurations done).</p>
<p>You can decide under the app&rsquo;s Settings menu to use mobile data.</p>
<p>You can set the mobile data limit it can use each month.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your current mobile plan has 20 G.B. and you constantly only use about 10 G.B. monthly. In that case, you can consider allocating the remaining mobile data to HoneyGain to increase your earnings.</p>
<p>The app resets the mobile data limit on the first day of each month.</p>
<h2 id="honeygain-dashboard"><span id="honeygain-dashboard" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Honeygain Dashboard</h2>
<p>Honeygain Dashboard is an important place that shows you all the stats and information you need to know.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-762 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-1024x418.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x209/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Overview-of-HoneyGain-Dashboard" width="512" height="209" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-1024x418.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-300x122.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-768x313.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-1536x627.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1536w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1897w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-dashboard-overview-1024x418.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x209/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /><em>Overview of HoneyGain Dashboard</em></p>
<p>You should be entering your Dashboard at least once a day for the following purposes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your Lucky Pot and claim your daily bonus</li>
<li>Check your current balance in earnings</li>
<li>Request for Payoputt when you meet the minimum payout threshold of USD 20</li>
<li>Check the dashboard graph to see how much bandwidth you had shared, including content delivery</li>
<li>Add, remove, rename or restore a device</li>
<li>Get your own unique referral link to share with others</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content-delivery-explained"><span id="content-delivery-explained" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Content Delivery Explained</h2>
<p>When you see the option to enable &ldquo;Content Delivery&rdquo; under your Settings, you should always do so. At the time of writing, it is available for most users in most countries.</p>
<p>Content Delivery allows users to share their internet connection for bandwidth-intensive content such as images, videos, audio, VoIP, etc.</p>
<p>As Content Delivery only works on Wi-Fi connections and computer devices, it is safe to enable and allow it to use in the background. Currently, you cannot enable Content Delivery on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Sharing a personal experience here. Sometime back, I had to restart my computer while having HoneyGain running for a long time. Upon resuming the HoneyGain app, I noticed that the content delivery mode went back to &ldquo;In Queue&rdquo; and remained this way for several days.</p>
<p>During the wait, I could not earn from Content Delivery, and it took several days before it resumed back to normal mode.</p>
<p>In short, there is no guarantee that you will get back to Content Delivery mode anytime soon if you happen to restart your device. Instead, it will go back to the queuing status, and you have to wait until it resumes.</p>
<h2 id="lucky-pot-game"><span id="lucky-pot-game" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Lucky Pot Game</h2>
<p>You can only participate in the lucky pot game once a day. After that, you need to open the Honey Jar by clicking on it and see how many credits you won for yourself.</p>
<p>This is like a daily lucky draw event for the users.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-547 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus-1024x314.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x157/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Honey-pot-daily" width="512" height="157" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus-1024x314.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus-300x92.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus-768x235.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1122w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Honeygain-daily-notification-claim-bonus-1024x314.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x157/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /><em>Daily chance to win some credits</em></p>
<p>The game allows users to win up to 10 000&nbsp; credits (which are worth USD 10).</p>
<p>Based on personal experience, the typical daily credits to be won are 10 credits, 20 credits, 50, 100 and 1000 credits. Anything above 100 credits is considered rare.</p>
<p>To put things into perspective, ten credits are equivalent to USD 0.01 (1 cent).</p>
<h2 id="can-i-use-vpn-or-proxies"><span id="can-i-use-vpn-or-proxies" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Can I use VPN or Proxies?</h2>
<p>I would strongly discourage the use of VPNs and Proxies.</p>
<p>The reason here lies in your I.P. address.</p>
<p>VPNs are often shared among many different users who connect themselves to that particular country server. Therefore, getting suspended when multiple HoneyGain accounts share the same I.P. address.</p>
<p>When you connect to a VPN and use HoneyGain, you may also encounter an error that says &ldquo;Network overused&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Disconnect your VPN connection and use your Wi-Fi or mobile data connection instead.</p>
<h2 id="honeygain-referral-program"><span id="honeygain-referral-program" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Honeygain Referral Program</h2>
<p>To encourage more users to share their unused internet connections with&nbsp;HoneyGain, the company introduces a referral program that rewards you daily.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>First of all, you should be recommending HoneyGain to your friends who you think might be interested in earning through this passive income app.</p>
<p>Then In your HoneyGain Dashboard under Referrals, you will see a blue button that says &ldquo;Invite friends&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you click on it, you will see your own unique referral URL link (screenshot below)</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-735 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-referral-code.png?ezimgfmt=rs:326x263/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="HoneyGain-Referral-Code-found-in-Dashboard-settings" width="326" height="263" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-referral-code.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 326w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-referral-code-300x242.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/honeygain-referral-code.png?ezimgfmt=rs:326x263/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /></p>
<p>Within the URL contains your referral code. You can either share the full link or just the code with your friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your friends&nbsp;sign up using your link or code&nbsp;and start sharing their internet bandwidth with Honeygain, 10% of their daily earnings will be added to your account.</p>
<h2 id="regarding-payouts"><span id="regarding-payouts" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Regarding Payouts</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-minimum-payout-amount-required"><span id="what-is-the-minimum-payout-amount-required" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What is the minimum payout amount required?</h3>
<p>To withdraw your HoneyGain earnings, you need to reach at least USD 20 (or the equivalent of 20,000 credits) in your balance earnings.</p>
<p>This payout threshold is the same for any user, regardless of your country. In addition, Ou will see your current USD amount and credits balance on your main screen (see example below).</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there will be specific transaction fees for cashing out in Bitcoin, and it will be explained later in this article.</p>

<p>You will then be brought to the next screen to select your preferred Payment Method.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-different-payoputt-methods-available"><span id="what-are-the-different-payout-methods-available" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What are the different payout methods available?</h3>
<p>At the time of this writing, HoneyGain offers two modes of payout alternatives.</p>
<p>You can choose to be paid either through Paypal or Bitcoin.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-442 ezlazyloaded" src="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin-1024x819.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x410/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="Honeygain-payout-method-choose-paypal-or-bitcoin" width="512" height="410" data-ezsrcset="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin-1024x819.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1024w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin-300x240.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 300w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin-768x614.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1118w" data-ezsrc="https://www.cobryle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HoneyGain-payout-request-in-Paypal-and-Bitcoin-1024x819.png?ezimgfmt=rs:512x410/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" /><em>Choosing between Paypal or Bitcoin</em></p>
<h3 id="which-is-better-paypal-bitcoin-or-jumptoken"><span id="which-is-better-paypal-bitcoin-or-jumptoken" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Which is better? Paypal, Bitcoin or JumpToken?</h3>
<p>This largely depends on your personal needs for this payout amount.</p>
<p>For me, I do not intend to use this $20 anytime soon. Therefore I would prefer to keep the entire payout amount and &ldquo;park&rdquo; it as a form of cryptocurrency. Thus choosing Bitcoin (BTC) will be my leading choice here.</p>
<p>All you need to do is provide HoneyGain (during the payout request stage) with your Bitcoin wallet address details, and they will transfer the equivalent of USD $20 of Bitcoin to my wallet in about 2 business days.</p>
<p>For simplicity and ease of use, get your free Bitcoin deposit wallet address at either&nbsp;Binance,&nbsp;Bittrex,&nbsp;Coinbase&nbsp;or&nbsp;Gate.io. Signing up is instant but the verification process usually takes a few business days. Be mindful of registering early while you can.</p>
<p>Honeygain&nbsp;engages their 3rd party payout provider, Tipalti, to deal with Paypal withdrawals.</p>
<p><em><span>Why do I prefer to be paid in Bitcoin (BTC)?</span></em></p>
<p>Personally, I believe in the slow, gradual potential rise of specific cryptocurrencies, not only just BTC. With that in mind, there is a real possible chance of my $20 (and more future payouts) growing into something way bigger one day.</p>
<p>However, If you need to withdraw, cash out and use the payout, Paypal will be the best option. The USD currency will be converted to your local currency in Paypal if you are not living in the U.S.</p>
<p>With Paypal, you can use it to pay for items online, transfer them to someone quickly and even deposit it to your local bank account within a few working days.</p>
<p>Check out&nbsp;Tipalti&rsquo;s support page&nbsp;to see if Paypal&rsquo;s funding currency (USD) is available for conversion to your local currency.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-payout-processing-fees-involved"><span id="are-there-any-payout-processing-fees-involved" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Are there any payout processing fees involved?</h3>
<h4 id="choosing-paypal"><span id="choosing-paypal" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Choosing Paypal</h4>
<p>When using the Paypal payout method, we need to remember that there will be two different processing fees involved.</p>
<p>One is fees imposed by Tipalti, and the other is fees charged by Paypal itself.</p>
<p>Using a real-life example that I had using the Paypal method, a sum of USD 1.47 is deducted from the actual payout request amount of USD 23.26, leaving the Net Amount to be USD 21.79.</p>
<p>Therefore USD 1.47 is the total transaction fees imposed by both Tipalti and Paypal, and this works out to approximately 6.32% of processing fees.</p>
<p>Fees by Tipalti are as follows;</p>
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<thead>
<tr><th>Residence</th><th>Fees per payment</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>U.S. Resident</td>
<td>USD $1 + 2% (up to USD $2 cap)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Non-US Resident</td>
<td>USD $1 + 2% (up to USD $21 cap)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>if you request a payout in a different currency than USD, an exchange fee of 2.50% applies.</p>
<p>Fees by Paypal can be found&nbsp;here.</p>
<h4 id="choosing-bitcoin"><span id="choosing-bitcoin" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Choosing Bitcoin</h4>
<p>HoneyGain engages their appointed conversion agent, BitcoinAverage, to do the USD to Bitcoin conversion rate.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience using this BTC payout method, the conversion rate is acceptable as it offers a slightly higher rate than the average moving Bitcoin price.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-processing-time-duration-for-payout"><span id="what-is-the-processing-timeduration-for-payout" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>What is the processing time/duration for payout?</h3>
<p>Based on my personal attempts to withdraw out to my Paypal account and Bitcoin wallet on separate occasions, both of their processing duration took exactly 2 business days to reach me.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span id="conclusion" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="is-using-honeygain-worth-it"><span id="is-using-honeygain-worth-it" class="uag-toc__heading-anchor"></span>Is using Honeygain worth it?</h3>
<p>In my personal view, yes, it sure is.</p>
<p>This is, by far, the most effortless automated passive way of earning a small income every month by simply keeping the app running in the background.</p>
<p>HoneyGain&nbsp;offers a truly automated passive income method where users could &ldquo;install and forget&rdquo; while leaving the app running in the background.</p>
<p>The company pays its users, and I have had multiple payouts so far.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend it to anyone because we have devices at home that use Wi-Fi and mobile devices with excess mobile data every month.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be rich but let&rsquo;s be fair, this app is running on auto-pilot mode.</p>
<p>Achieving a target of USD 20 every month through HoneyGain earnings is possible here.</p>
<p>Being so passive and automatic, I cannot see why one would not try it out.</p>
