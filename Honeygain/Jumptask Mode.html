<p id="isPasted">JumpTask mode is an alternative way to earn while using Honeygain. After enabling the JumpTask mode via the web dashboard of your Honeygain account, all the earnings you make will be gained in JumpTokens (JMPT) instead of Honeygain credits.</p>
<p>These JumpTokens will be added to your JumpTask wallet, from which you will be able to convert them to other crypto or fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Please note that switching to JumpTask mode is not a permanent decision &ndash; you will still be able to switch back to the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Honeygain mode and continue earning Honeygain credits if you wish to do so.</p>

<p id="isPasted">Note: The message "Get started with the first app - Honeygain" on the JumpTask dashboard will go away, as soon as you start earning to JumpTask wallet, which should happen within 5 minutes after linking Honeygain and JumpTask accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Honeygain web dashboard on any device or the Honeygain application on your Android device.</li>

<li>A popup window will appear. Click on &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start!&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You will now have to enter the public address of your wallet that you wish to use with JumpTask. If you don&rsquo;t have one yet, please refer to this guide on how to create a BSC (Binance Smart Chain) wallet which is supported by the JumpTask platform.</li>
<li>You will be asked to enter a 2FA code that you&rsquo;ll receive in your Honeygain registration email.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Next, click on &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s JumpTask&rdquo;.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s it! You now have JumpTask mode enabled on your Honeygain account. If you are not quite sure what happens now that JumpTask mode is enabled.</li>

<h1 id="isPasted" title="The benefits of JumpTask mode">The benefits of JumpTask mode</h1>
<p>With JumpTask mode being introduced to Honeygain, there are a few unique advantages that make it worth using.</p>
<p>One of the most important benefits is that you no longer have to reach the $20 payout threshold in order to request a payout. All the credits you accumulate while on JumpTask mode will be converted into JumpTokens and added to your JumpTask wallet.</p>
<p>Also, at the current time, there is a +10% increase in your earnings while using the JumpTask mode, which means that you get an extra 10% of your earnings (this includes Lucky pot winnings and income from referrals). For example, if you had earned 100 credits, you would instead receive 110 credits due to this bonus.</p>
<p>Another important benefit is that with JumpTask mode enabled, the transaction fees will be lower than ever before. All the credits you earn on Honeygain will be transferred to the JumpTask wallet with only the gas fee of the blockchain involved. You will keep earning effortlessly as usual, but your earnings will now fall into your JumpTask wallet in the form of JumpTokens, and the fees will always be kept to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p>Last but not least &ndash; instant payouts. Previously, you would have waited for about 2&ndash;3 business days for a PayPal payout to be processed. There were also transaction fees applied during the payout process. As for Bitcoin, you would have waited for about a week, sometimes even more, due to the high amount of transactions and load in the Bitcoin blockchain. Sometimes this could have even resulted in receiving less money than you requested because of a drop in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price. With JumpTask mode, that is no longer an issue: the credits you earn are instantly transferred to your JumpTask wallet in the form of JumpTokens, eliminating the long and stressful wait for your payout to arrive.</p>
