<p><span>Honeygain is the first-ever app that allows users to make money by sharing their internet. In this Honeygain review, I&rsquo;ll show you how to make money doing nothing, the pros and cons of the app, and whether this passive income opportunity is right for you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-introduction"><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>I&nbsp;<span><em>love&nbsp;</em></span>passive income.</p>
<p>Passive income is money you make that requires little to no effort to earn and maintain. My list of the&nbsp;<span>best passive income ideas</span>&nbsp;is one of the most popular posts on this site.</p>
<p><span>When I was in college</span>, one of the best ways to make money on the internet was to install a toolbar that showed ads while you surfed the net. As a poor college student, it was a great way to make money. I just left my computer on, installed software to randomly move the mouse so the toolbar thought we were there, and kept cashing the checks when they came in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was perfect.</p>
<p>Those were the wild west days of the internet and opportunities like that are long gone, but I&rsquo;ve recently learned of something about as close as you can get to it &ndash; it&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<span>Honeygain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honeygain is an app that, when turned on, allows you to get paid for your unused internet.</p>
<p>To put it simply, no one is ever using the full capacity of their internet (unless you&rsquo;re massively downloading things 24/7 or bitcoin farming). This is where Honeygain comes in; they will use the data you don&rsquo;t and pay you for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>available to download</span>&nbsp;on Windows and MacOS computers along with Android phones. Unfortunately, an iOS (iPhone) version is not available.</p>

<p>For smart phone users, you can use your mobile data for this, but if you connect to any Wi-Fi, the app will continue to work. This means you don&rsquo;t have to spend anything at all to make money.</p>

<p>Naturally, you&rsquo;d want to know what your unused internet will be used for and whether or not it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>Honeygain is very transparent about this. Data scientists use the platform to connect to the internet to perform things like market research and ad verification while Honeygain manages all these connections with strict safeguards to protect all parties.</p>
<p>In other words, the internet is used by trusted companies doing bland errands.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an illustration when Honeygain uses the internet for ad verification:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-4474 entered lazyloaded" src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification.png" alt="Honeygain ad verification illustration" width="800" height="433" data-lazy-srcset="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification.png 800w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification-300x162.png 300w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification-768x416.png 768w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification-696x377.png 696w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification-776x420.png 776w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification-50x27.png 50w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-lazy-src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Ad-Verification.png" data-ll-status="loaded" />(Image from Honeygain)</div>
<p>Additionally, none of your personal information is ever shared or used. The app will never gain access to your device&rsquo;s storage. The only information they measure is how much internet traffic they used from you in order to pay you properly.</p>
<p>To verify their claim, I looked into Honeygain&rsquo;s app setting on my phone. I can see that&nbsp;<span>no permissions are required</span>&nbsp;for the app to run:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-4518 entered lazyloaded" src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required.jpg" alt="No permissions required for Honeygain app" width="324" height="608" data-lazy-srcset="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required.jpg 324w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required-160x300.jpg 160w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required-224x420.jpg 224w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required-27x50.jpg 27w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" data-lazy-src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Required.jpg" data-ll-status="loaded" />(Screenshot of Honeygain app)</div>
<p>The Honeygain app is also&nbsp;<span>not allowed to access my phone storage device, pictures, or files</span>:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-4519 entered lazyloaded" src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Allowed.jpg" alt="No permissions allowed on Honeygain app" width="324" height="289" data-lazy-srcset="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Allowed.jpg 324w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Allowed-300x268.jpg 300w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Allowed-50x45.jpg 50w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" data-lazy-src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-No-Permissions-Allowed.jpg" data-ll-status="loaded" />(Screenshot of Honeygain app)</div>
<p>I have no worries due to Honeygain&rsquo;s transparency, the companies they&rsquo;re working with, and the very limited amount of information they collect from users.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s very safe.</p>
<h2 id="h-how-much-money-can-you-make-with-honeygain"><span id="How_Much_Money_Can_You_Make_With_Honeygain">How Much Money Can You Make With Honeygain?</span></h2>
<p>Once you&nbsp;<span>download the app</span>, you&rsquo;ll instantly make $5 by using the referral code&nbsp;<span>MONEYNINJA</span>&nbsp;when you register.</p>
<p>From here, how much money you can make with Honeygain depends on how much internet traffic you share. The more you share, the more you earn.</p>
<p>You earn &ldquo;credits&rdquo;, and&nbsp;<span>every 1,000 credits is worth $1</span>.</p>
<p>There are actually two different ways to earn credits: Default Network Sharing and Content Delivery Sharing.</p>
<h3 id="h-default-network-sharing"><span id="Default_Network_Sharing">Default Network Sharing</span></h3>
<div class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-4523 entered lazyloaded" src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot.jpg" alt="Honeygain dashboard screenshot" width="324" height="608" data-lazy-srcset="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot.jpg 324w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot-160x300.jpg 160w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot-224x420.jpg 224w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot-27x50.jpg 27w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" data-lazy-src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Dashboard-Screenshot.jpg" data-ll-status="loaded" />(Screenshot of Honeygain app)</div>
<p>Default Network Sharing is the standard way to earn on Honeygain. When the app is active, you&rsquo;ll start to earn credits based on the traffic that goes through your network.</p>
<p>The current rate for&nbsp;<span>Default Network Sharing is 1 credit for 10 MB of traffic</span>.</p>
<p>To get 1,000 credits, you would then need 10,000 MB (10 GB) of traffic.</p>
<p><span>This means that 10 GB = $1 USD.</span></p>
<p>You can connect multiple devices (no device limits per user, but only 2 devices maximum on the same network) to speed up the pace of earning credits.</p>
<p>The tricky part of this is that demand for Honeygain&rsquo;s service is uneven.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the demand is high and there are few Honeygain users on, you&rsquo;ll make more renting out your internet connection. Other times, the demand can still be high, but if there are a lot of users on, the demand is more spread out.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re located also plays a part in your earnings. Some locations are more in demand than others.</p>
<p>On average,&nbsp;<span>I&rsquo;d expect most people to make around $5 to $10 a month</span>&nbsp;using the Default Network Sharing option.</p>
<p>Not huge by any means, but it&rsquo;s totally free money. Now let&rsquo;s pair this up with the Content Delivery Option.</p>
<h3 id="h-content-delivery-sharing"><span id="Content_Delivery_Sharing">Content Delivery Sharing</span></h3>
<div class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-4526 entered lazyloaded" src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration.png" alt="Honeygain Content Delivery illustration" width="777" height="309" data-lazy-srcset="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration.png 777w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration-300x119.png 300w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration-768x305.png 768w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration-696x277.png 696w, https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration-50x20.png 50w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" data-lazy-src="https://themoneyninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honeygain-Content-Delivery-Illustration.png" data-ll-status="loaded" />(Image from Honeygain)</div>
<p>Content Delivery is a new feature with Honeygain and the company&rsquo;s answer to the annoying aspect of not being able to predict your monthly earnings more accurately.</p>
<p>With Content Delivery, you&rsquo;ll earn credits based on the duration of time that a desktop device is connected, regardless if your internet is needed or not.</p>
<p>The current rate of&nbsp;<span>Content Delivery is 10 credits for 1 hour of leaving the app open</span>.</p>
<p><span>This means that 24 hours = 240 credits.</span></p>
<p>By turning on Content Delivery (which works alongside the regular Default Network Sharing),&nbsp;<span>you can earn an additional $7.20 per month</span>.</p>
<p>This is on top of the $5 to $10 a month you&rsquo;d earn with Default Network Sharing for an estimated total monthly earnings of $10.20 to $15.20.</p>
<h4 id="h-eligible-devices"><span id="Eligible_Devices">Eligible Devices</span></h4>
<p>Content Delivery is&nbsp;<span>available on desktop devices</span>&nbsp;only (Windows and macOS).</p>
<p>Why only desktop devices?</p>
<ol>
<li>Desktop devices usually have unlimited data plans or rely solely on a Wi-Fi connection.</li>
<li>Desktop devices have a more stable connection, which is required for businesses who use Content Delivery.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="h-how-to-activate-content-delivery"><span id="How_To_Activate_Content_Delivery">How To Activate Content Delivery</span></h4>
<p>Simply download the app on your desktop computer and enable the Content Delivery feature from there. That&rsquo;s it! Your device is ready to join Content Delivery.</p>

<p>Honeygain is a completely legit way to earn small amounts of passive income every month, which would be enough to fully cover the costs of subscription services like Amazon Prime, Netflix, or Spotify.</p>
<p>While you won&rsquo;t make millions with this app, it&rsquo;s another excellent way to earn income passively.</p>
<p>No single app will replace a full-time salary, but combine this option with other ways to make money and you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to contributing a significant source of money outside of your &ldquo;real&rdquo; job.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great way to make money by doing nothing!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re less comfortable renting out your internet, you could always make money in other ways &ndash; like surfing the internet and taking surveys with&nbsp;<span>Swagbucks</span>. It&rsquo;s less passive since you need to click a few links and answer some questions, but it&rsquo;s been around for ages and more well-known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
