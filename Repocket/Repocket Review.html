    <p>Whenever you have unused Internet data, Repocket will automatically use it in their network of companies. The
        amount of money you earn will depend on how much data you have and how much the companies are willing to pay for
        it.</p>
    <p>The process is pretty simple &ndash; after installing the app, you just need to keep it running in the background
        while you go about your normal internet usage. Repocket will then track your data usage and give you money for
        every MB that you don&rsquo;t use. Since most of us have data plans with more than we actually need, this is an
        easy way to earn a few bucks without having to do anything extra.</p>

            data you have available.</li>
        <li>The company pays for each and every MB of data that you provide to them.</li>

            hours your devices are connected and data is shared.</li>
        <li>You may earn $10-$120 each month by sharing your data. To earn $50, you must share 120GB of data for 720
            hours every month on 2 devices. This indicates that the app must be online 24 hours a day, seven days a
            week.</li>
        <li>The app runs in the background, making it simple to earn money every time your smartphone or tablet connects
